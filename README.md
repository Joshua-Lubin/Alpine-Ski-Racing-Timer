### Top Python Code
The current python code in the GitHub repository is outdated. It is a designed to be used on a PC system, rather than an actual raspberry pi. So, it has a PyQt5 based GUI instead of the eInk display that is included in the final product. I would upload code for the eInk display, except my only copy is in the raspberry pi, which is located in Davis, California at my parent's house and I am currently in Tempe, Arizona.
